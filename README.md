# Live Coding Challenge: Debugging a Warehouse Application

## Scenario

You are presented with a simple warehouse application where users can order items, and after a certain period, the items are delivered. One customer has lodged a complaint that an item he ordered was not delivered. Your task is to investigate the issue by examining the provided log file and SQL result log, identify the problem, and fix it.

## Instructions

1. **Analyze the Log Files**:
    - Review the contents of the provided `log.txt` file to trace the sequence of events related to the customer's order.

2. **Identify the Issue**:
    - Determine why the customer's order was not delivered by analyzing the logs and understanding the application's workflow.
    - Pinpoint the exact cause of the issue, whether it is due to a bug in the application logic, a database transaction failure, or another reason.

3. **Fix the Issue**:
    - Implement the necessary code changes to resolve the issue.
    - Ensure that the fix addresses the root cause and that similar issues will not occur for other customers.

4. **Document Your Findings**:
    - Write a brief explanation of what caused the issue and how you fixed it.
    - Include any changes you made to the code, along with comments explaining the purpose of the changes.

## Provided Files

- `log.txt`: The application log file containing the sequence of events.
- 
## Requirements

- You must use Java for coding.
- Your solution should be efficient and maintainable.
- Ensure that all changes are thoroughly tested to confirm the issue is resolved.
